# ITERATION 1

## Retrospective report

Realese Link: https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC10T2/releases/tag/v1

### 1. What went well?

Over the last two weeks we have managed to develop our product in such a way that there is a clear evolution, have developed all our must-have issues.

### 2. What didn’t go so well?

We would have liked to explore our issues further in order to complete them in their entirety. We will keep this in mind for the next iterations.

### 3. What have I learned?

In this iteration we learnt how to use the firebase and expand our knowledge of the google maps API.

### 4. What still puzzles me?

We still have some difficulties with Flutter and the firebase integration.

# ITERATION 2

## Retrospective report

Realese Link: https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC10T2/releases/tag/v2

### 1. What went well?

We believe that we have made significant progress in improving our product with better design and the implementation of new functionalities. The updated design has enhanced the user experience, making it more intuitive and visually appealing. Additionally, the introduction of new functionalities, including those that utilize Google Maps API, has expanded the product's capabilities, improving its efficiency and effectiveness.

### 2. What didn’t go so well?

During our recent development efforts, we faced challenges in completing user stories due to our dependence on Firebase comprehension. Although we were able to acquire some understanding of Firebase, it came later in the development process and was not sufficient to fully implement all the desired functionalities. 

### 3. What have I learned?

We believe we have improved our understanding of Flutter testing and deepened our knowledge of Firebase.

### 4. What still puzzles me?

While we have acquired some knowledge about Firebase and testing during this iteration, we acknowledge that we are not yet entirely comfortable with these aspects. We are committed to addressing this shortfall as soon as possible and taking necessary steps to remedy the situation.

# ITERATION 3

## Retrospective report

Realese Link: https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC10T2/releases/tag/v3

### 1. What went well?

In this iteration, we focused our attention towards enhancing the user experience of our application by renovating its design and incorporating new features. Once again, we utilized the Google Maps API to integrate location-based functionalities. As we had already been using the Google Maps API for some time, we were more comfortable with it and found it easier to implement user location features.

### 2. What didn’t go so well?

Things didn't go as smoothly as we had hoped during this iteration. We had some trouble testing the app, and we couldn't make as much progress as we wanted to. Plus, a team member didn't pull their weight, and that made it harder to get everything done. So unfortunately, we weren't able to reach all of the goals we had set for ourselves this time around.

### 3. What have I learned?

As we progressed with the redesign of our application and the implementation of new features using the Google Maps API, we were able to deepen our understanding of Flutter and its potential. In particular, we explored a new aspect of the Google Maps API - user location and marker costumization - and gained valuable insights from the experience. This enabled us to expand our knowledge base and enhance our proficiency in working with these powerful tools.

### 4. What still puzzles me?

Despite the progress we have made in developing issues, we are still encountering significant challenges in the testing phase. In particular, calling the appropriate widgets and testing Firebase integration has proven to be a difficult and puzzling process. Moving forward, it will be crucial to dedicate more time and resources to exploring potential solutions and experimenting with different approaches.

# ITERATION 4

## Retrospective report

Realese Link: https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC10T2/releases/tag/v4

### 1. What went well?

We made significant advancements in testing. We also believe we have successfully implemented most of our main features.


### 2. What didn’t go so well?

Unfortunately, we were unable to complete all of our user stories. Our testing efforts were limited due to the late acquisition of knowledge during the development stage.

### 3. What have I learned?

In this iteration, we have especially learned a valuable lesson about tests, particularly in understanding the effective use of Gherkin language.


### 4. What still puzzles me?
We feel confident that we have maximized our efforts and achieved the most with this project. We have utilized our available resources effectively and gained a comprehensive understanding of the concepts involved.
